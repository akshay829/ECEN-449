# ECEN 449 Lab Repository

This repository contains my work from ECEN 449 lab. You can find the lab requirements as well as my solutions here. 

This is only meant to showcase my work to the public. If you are currently taking ECEN 449 at Texas A&M University or plan to take it, please wait until the end of your term to download or look at these solutions.
